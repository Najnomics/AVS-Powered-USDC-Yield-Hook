# AVS-Powered-USDC-Yield-Hook
An intelligent Uniswap v4 Hook that leverages EigenLayer's Actively Validated Services (AVS) to monitor cross-protocol yield opportunities and automatically rebalances USDC positions using Circle's Wallets and CCTP v2. This system creates the first fully automated, institutionally-focused yield optimization protocol built natively into Uniswap v4.
